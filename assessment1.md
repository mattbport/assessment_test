## Assessment 1 
### Original software artefact (70%): due Friday ?? December 2023

The primary assessment for Audio Programming is an original VST audio plugin. This artefact should be engineered in C++. In some cases alternative languages may be used but this must be discussed with and approved by the module co-ordinator.

All affiliated source code for the project should be submitted. If you would like to draw the examiner's attention to portions of the source code, you should document this within the source code in comments.

As the major assessed component of this unit, the software artefact is the primary means in which you can showcase your knowledge, skills as both a developer and creative practitioner. As such, you may wish to create a collection of presets for your plugin to highlight its functionality and sonic output.

A video demonstration of the artefact MUST be provided highlighting the core features and setup of the application. Guidance on how to do this can be found below.

The submission should contain a basic README file summarizing its aims and your vision for how it should be used in creative practice. The readme file should directly indicate to the examiner how the software should be used. For example, if your software runs from the command line and requires that you provide the name of a file to work with, the readme should direct the examiners to do so. It is not required that you provide input audio files for the software, however, you may choose to do so if you feel a certain sound or set of sounds highlight aspects of your submission. If sounds are provided, they should be entirely open source or have been created by yourself. You may not use any materials that are copyrighted.

It is advisable that the submission should be version controlled using Git and a link to a Github, GitLab or Bitbucket page should be provided. The submitted version should be tagged as "UPXXX_Aupro_Submission" in the Git repository. It is advisable that you download and submit the zip folder that is created on these services when a tagged code commit is uploaded.
