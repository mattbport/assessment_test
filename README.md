# Unit abstract
This module aims to develop students programming skills through the specification, design and development of a programmed audio artefact. Students will focus on applying and refining their coding, debugging techniques to their knowledge of audio effects, DSP and computational music. Audio programming can require many different tools and practices dependent on the artistic, scientific or commercial context. This module presents an overview of these different aspects of audio programming while exploring key concepts that permeate most audio programming projects.
