# Submission details
You must submit a zip folder to the submission dropbox on Moodle and it must contain the following:

* A video demonstration illustrating the core features and setup of the artefact.
* An installer for your artefact.
* A README text file with a link to an online Git repository for the codebase, usage instructions and documentation of controls and presets (if required).
* All source code and build instructions as a Zip folder (this could be the tagged git commit).

Optionally, you may choose to also submit:

* Presets/templates for your software
* Example DAW session files(if required)
* Example input audio files (if required)

For poster submissions: you should submit a PDF of the poster to Moodle no later than 3PM on the day of the deadline.

Video submissions need to be in.mp4 format (or any format that runs in VLC Media Player) with h.264 encoding. The video must be assessable on its own, hence the code that you are writing should be clear and readable. Please make sure to check the legibility of the text in the video before you start recording. The audio in the video should be of a sufficient amplitude and all coded parts should be audible. Be sure to check the quality of the audio recording before you perform.

Please ensure that the video can be played with VLC before submitting. You can use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or Quicktime Player to record the video and Premiere or Handbrake (handbrake.fr) to convert it to mp4 format and encode it. For complicated audio setups, on Mac OS you can explore Loopback (<https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/> ) or BlackHole (<https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole>). On Windows Virtual Audio Cable can be used (<https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/> ). |
The minimum resolution is 1280x720 (720p), please choose 1920x1080 (1080p) if your system allows it. Please name your video accordingly, e.g. "IntoTheShadowsDEMO-up929221.mp4".
